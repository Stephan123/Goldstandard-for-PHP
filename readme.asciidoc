Koch's Goldstandard for PHP - A Coding Standard
-----------------------------------------------

This repository contains a set of code sniffs for PHP_CodeSniffer.

*This standard enforces:*

* PSR-0, PSR-1 and PSR-2
* the removal of old and deprecated PHP functions (This is helpful, when working with legacy code.)
* the usage of faster functions (Some premature or micro optimizations. Uh, oh! That's BAD! true?! :)

*Requirements*

You need PHP_CodeSniffer (http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).

*Installation via PEAR* +pear install PHP_CodeSniffer+

*Installation via PYRUS* +php pyrus.phar install pear/PHP_CodeSniffer+
